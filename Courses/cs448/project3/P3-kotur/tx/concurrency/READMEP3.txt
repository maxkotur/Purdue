I used WaitDieTest.java to test my code as I worked on option 2.
I added a while loop to make sure a transaction restarts after rollback.

You can use ConcurrencyTest.java if you want to remove the while loop and revert
to how the WaitDieTest.java originally was.

Furthermore, the Project3Tests.java in embedded was used for the compare
but that is only a sample as my other group partners are using their later
days to improve it since they are working on option 1. Thus no need to run
that file. It is only there as I mentioned it in my report to convey that I
have started the comparison. Its just that my other group members are not
ready yet.
