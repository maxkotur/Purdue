Hello! I am Maxime Kotur and I will list the things that I have implemented
for my shell project.

I have passed all test cases including wildcards.

I have completed ctrlc. It should be fully functional.
-Ctrl+C doesn’t kill the shell : works
-Ctrl+C kills “sleep 100” : works

I have completed edit mode. 
-History (up/down) : works
-Arrows : works
-(ctrl-D) : works
-(ctrl-H) : works
-Insert in the middle: doesn't work
(ctrl-A) : works
(ctrl-E) : works

I have also implemented partially path completion
- ls t<tab> will not complete the work but will suggest words that start with t
- ls test<tab> works as it shows all files starting with test
- you can try it with other things like 'cd test-<tab>' which will directly
cd you into test-shell

I have also implemented variable prompt
- variable prompt change : works
- variable on_error change : doesn't work

Additional Features:
- I have implemented a sound occurring every time you press tab.
- The shell will make a sound when <tab> is pressed to show that it has 
  understood and will give you the matching words. I think it is worth at 
  least 1 credit point.
